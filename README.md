### Errata
* Chapter name: **TypeScript Basics, page number: 46**- The below paragraph which is after point 10 is included bymistakely and should be ignored. 

   _However, omitting the parameter names arguably makes the interface harder to
    understandâ€”how do we know exactly what the parameter is for?_
    
* Page number: **100** - Create React App now uses a function component and so _step 5_ is no longer necessary.
* Page number: **106** - bundle.js should be removed from the folder listing.
